          <h2 class="section-title">I'm not a guru. I'm a guy who's been to the bottom. Twice.</h2>
          <p>I started in punk clubs at 13. By 18, I was a full-blown heroin addict. By 29, I had overdosed for the third time and woke up in a hospital with nothing but a donated green sweater, some worn-out running shoes, and bus fare.</p>
          <p>I strapped a tent to a motorcycle and rode across the country. In a thrift store in Cheyenne, Wyoming, I found a book that rewired how I saw myself. I landed in Austin, Texas, built a 14-bay auto shop from the ground up, then nearly lost it all when the IRS showed up at my door with a $300,000 tax bill.</p>
          <p>Both times I hit the bottom, I found a way out &mdash; not through luck, not through some miracle, but through learning how to focus on solutions instead of problems, how to silence the stories that were keeping me stuck, and how to lead with integrity.</p>
          <p class="accent-text">I promised God in the darkest moment of my life that if I got out, I'd help other people. This is me keeping that promise.</p>

      <div class="faq-list">
        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>Is this a religious event?</summary>
          <p>No. I talk about my own faith because it's part of my story, but this isn't a church service. It's a practical, roll-up-your-sleeves experience for anyone, regardless of where they stand on that.</p>
        </details>
        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>I'm not an entrepreneur. Is this still for me?</summary>
          <p>Absolutely. The Solutions-First mindset applies to everything &mdash; your career, your relationships, your health, your personal growth. If you've got a pulse and a problem, this is for you.</p>
        </details>
        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>Is this like Tony Robbins or a motivational seminar?</summary>
          <p>No. I'm not going to have you walk on hot coals or high-five strangers. This is a working weekend &mdash; you're bringing your actual financials, digging into your actual situation, and building an actual 90-day plan. Think of it as a conversation with someone who's been through the worst and figured out what actually works.</p>
        </details>
        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>I can't leave my shop for a whole weekend.</summary>
          <p>You can't afford NOT to. How many weekends have you spent putting out fires that a better system would have prevented? This is two and a half days that change how you operate for the next decade.</p>
        </details>
        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>What if I've never been to rehab or had an IRS problem?</summary>
          <p>Good &mdash; I hope you haven't. But everybody has traditions. Everybody has stories they tell themselves that hold them back. You don't need to have hit rock bottom to benefit from learning how to wipe the slate and focus on solutions.</p>
        </details>
        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>I don't want to share my financials with strangers.</summary>
          <p>Everything is confidential. And the person sitting next to you is just as nervous about it. That's the whole point &mdash; you're not alone in this.</p>
        </details>
        <details class="faq-item">
          <summary>I've been to things like this before and nothing changed.</summary>
          <p>That's because most events give you motivation. We give you a plan, a partner, and a deadline. You're not leaving here with a warm feeling. You're leaving with homework.</p>
